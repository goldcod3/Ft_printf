# Ft_printf
Function ft_printf developed in 42Madrid.

Resume: The objective of this project is to reprogram the printf() function and learn how to use a variable number of arguments.

A static library must be created using the '[libft](https://github.com/goldcod3/Libft)' library and include the printf() function.

## Compile Options:

```
$ make
```
The **make** rule will compile the whole library generating a static library 'libftprintf.a' containing all the functions of the project.
```
$ make clean
```
The **clean** rule will delete all objects created to compile the library 'libftprintf.a'.
```
$ make fclean
```
The **fclean** rule will delete all created objects and the 'libftprintf.a' file that has been previously compiled.
```
$ make re
```
The **re** rule will remove all compiled objects and files (if any) and recompile the library.

Finished project.
